# Distribution Identification Tool

## Overview
A rule-based statistical tool that provides an indicative assessment of possible discrete probability distributions based on user input and basic statistical properties such as mean and variance.

Built using core Python fundamentals without external libraries.

## Concepts Used
- Variables and data types  
- Lists and loops  
- Conditional statements  
- Functions  
- Basic statistics 

## Features
- Suggests possible discrete probability distributions from the values provided.
- Calculates basic statistical properties like mean and variance.
- Rule-based approach with no external libraries required.

## Learning Journey Context
This project was completed at the end of Week 1 of my Python learning journey. It focuses on fundamental Python concepts and basic statistical reasoning.

## Notes
- Distributions are suggested using classical, rule-based statistical assumptions.
- Results are indicative and require further validation for real-world use.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Navigate to the project folder  
3. Run:
```bash
python3 distribution-identification-tool.py
```
